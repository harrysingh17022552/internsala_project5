# PRoject Requirement

To Check the functionality and logics required, please visit attached pdf.
From that required I had modified the one functionality of browseBook Component that is dynamically listing the categorized book, because that functionality I have given at home page to visit dynamically category page, and on browseBook page I have given functionality to filter as per category statically. That looks more better according to me.
